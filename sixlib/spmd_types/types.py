class Shard:
    """
    A refinement of Varying that specifies the tensor is sharded on a particular
    dimension.

    While Varying (V) only says "each rank has different data" without
    specifying how ranks relate to a global tensor, Shard(dim) additionally
    says "the global tensor can be reconstructed by concatenating the local
    tensors along dimension ``dim``."  This is analogous to DTensor's
    ``Shard(dim)`` placement.

    This is not a true type (notice it doesn't inherit from PerMeshAxisLocalSpmdType)
    but it is accepted at any src/dst argument and, from a typing perspective,
    is equivalent to Varying.  However, it does change the semantics of collectives
    by switching from stack/unbind semantics (V) to concat/split semantics (S):

    - ``all_gather(src=V)``: stacks per-rank tensors on a new dim 0
      (output gains a dimension).
    - ``all_gather(src=S(i))``: concatenates per-rank tensors along dim ``i``
      (output has the same number of dimensions as each input).
    - ``reduce_scatter(dst=V)``: unbinds along dim 0 after reducing
      (output loses a dimension).
    - ``reduce_scatter(dst=S(i))``: splits along dim ``i`` after reducing
      (output has the same number of dimensions, but dim ``i`` shrinks).

    In practice, most users want concat/split (S) rather than stack/unbind (V),
    because tensors are typically sharded along an existing dimension.

    In global SPMD types, a per-mesh-axis Shard can also be used to manipulate
    the PartitionSpec in a mesh-oriented way, although the PartitionSpec is still
    the canonical way of representing this typing information.
